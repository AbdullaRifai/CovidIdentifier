# CovidIdentifier 
## 1. Python ML project

Details:
- This code trains on a different corpus depending on the need for the demo. My last demo was about covid, I have included a video to show how the code works without having to pickle the trained model as it shows how the code works. 

- The code trains an ML model on a corpus (data) and provides a confidence score based on the input text, whether this text is related to covid or not. This is done by comparing key terms after filtering the text of stopwords and other noise (as much as possible)

- This is a small 1 minute demo, hope you like it! Casual Agent meaning no Corona-virus related text, Covid-agent means the text has a relation to corona virus.

Purpose: 
This was just a proof of concept that I made in a matter of a day or two, further optimizations were made but I cannot share the final code because of copyright issues (as I was employed while working on this). I will provide a refrence that will speak more about this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read over my work! :grin:
